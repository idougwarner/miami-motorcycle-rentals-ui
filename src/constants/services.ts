      "What a GREAT service!! Not only a better price than EagleRider but a MUCH wider selection of rides. I had the opportunity to ride an Indian Chief for 5 days. I am a lifelong (40+ years) Harley rider but I have always admired the look of the Indian bikes and now I have had a chance to really try one out. So the guys at Miami Motorcycle Rental provided me with constant communication before, during and after my ride. Everything was straight forward and honest, the bikes are clean, in great condition and well equipped. They let me keep the bike one addition day without hassle. Everything you might need, they had. Easy to do business with, I would HIGHLY recommend them to any rider; sport, cruiser, or touring. I am so glad I found Rider Share and these pros at Miami Motorcycle Rental",
